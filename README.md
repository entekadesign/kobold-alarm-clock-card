# Kobold Alarm Clock

Kobold: A feature-rich alarm clock for Home Assistant.

Features:
- Set a schedule of alarm times, one for each day of the week
- Set one or more Home Assistant entities to be triggered by alarm
- Set one or more additional entities to activate X minutes before or after alarm
- Set an unscheduled alarm time easily while scheduled alarm remains active

Kobold is adapted from Ronald Dehuysser's [Lovelace Alarm Clock Card](https://github.com/rdehuyss/homeassistant-lovelace-alarm-clock-card).
